- The following file was written and added to a premade pygame project 
  which had a functional connect4 game but no AI.

- The goal was to write some AIs based on game trees 
  and to let them play the game against each other.
  Algorithms used were NegaScout and Minimax with alpha-beta prunning. 

- Afterwards, I personalized the game for a friend 
  who used to play connect4 during classes in school.
