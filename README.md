<br/>
- This was a short university homework assignment where we were given a premade pygame project <br/>
  which had a functional k-puzzle game with everything except for the AI. <br/>
- The goal was to write some AIs to solve the randomly generated k-puzzle game <br/>
  based on some of the common pathfinding algorithms: BFS, BestFirst and A*. <br/>

<br/>
- This was a short university homework assignment <br/>
  where we were given a premade pygame project <br/>
  which had a functional connect4 game but no AI. <br/>
- The goal was to write some AIs based on game trees <br/>
  and to let them play the game against each other. <br/>
  Algorithms used were NegaScout and Minimax with alpha-beta prunning. <br/>
- Afterwards, I personalized the game for a friend <br/>
  who used to play connect4 during classes in school. <br/>
