- The following files were written and added to a premade pygame project 
  which had a functional k-puzzle game with everything except for the AI.

- The goal was to write some AIs to solve the randomly generated k-puzzle game 
  based on some of the common pathfinding algorithms: BFS, BestFirst and A*.
